[15:30:14] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <andy> Yes, I have 1 iron ingot. How many do you have? We need a total of 2 ingots to craft a shear.
[15:30:14] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <randy> Hey Andy, I don't have any iron ingots right now. Let's work together to find some iron ore and smelt it. I'll start looking around for iron ore. !entities

[15:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <randy> Currently, I have no iron ingots. Could you tell me where you got them so I can try to mine some more? Or maybe we can see if there's a way to find another one in the area.
[15:30:19] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <andy> I found my iron ingot nearby while mining, but I don't see any more around me right now. I'll help you search for iron ore too. Let's see what's around me. !nearbyBlocks

[15:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <andy> I've found some iron ore nearby. I'll go ahead and collect it so we can smelt it into iron ingots. !collectBlocks("iron_ore", 1)
[15:30:24] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <randy> Andy, it looks like I don't have the right tools to mine the iron ore. Could you lend me a pickaxe, or do you have one we could use nearby?
[15:30:25] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <andy> I don't have the right tools to harvest iron ore. Randy, could you help me mine this iron ore if you have a pickaxe?
[15:30:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <randy> Unfortunately, I don't have a pickaxe either. Let's keep an eye out for a crafting table nearby or resources to make one. If we find wood, we can craft a wooden pickaxe to mine the iron ore. 
[15:30:27] [Server thread/INFO]: [Not Secure] <andy> I don't have a pickaxe either. Let me check for craftable items and see if we can make one. !craftable
